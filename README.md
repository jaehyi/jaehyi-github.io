# Welcome to my GitHub!

### Hi, my name is Jae Yi, and this is a place where I will be showcasing my work and collaborating with others to create projects that will have positive and meaningful impact on lives of many. A transitioning Army veteran with almost 24 years of service to the nation, I am currently a student in Microsoft Software & Systems Academy (MSSA) with Quantico Cohort 7, learning furiously everything about C#, TSQL, ASP.NET, and Azure to be a Cloud Application Developer.  My ultimate goal is to empower others to achieve more.
